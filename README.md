## Sources

* https://github.com/share/sharedb [JavaScript] - Realtime database backend based on Operational Transformation of JSON documents, uses MongoDB and Redis
* https://github.com/rizzoma [CoffeeScript/JavaScript] - Google Wave clone based on ShareDB
* https://github.com/gritzko/swarm [JavaScript] - CRDT implementation
* https://github.com/gulf [JavaScript] - Operational transformation control layer with several bindings to contenteditable, quill editor, socialcalc. Though the author says he found something better than OT - CRDT
* https://github.com/dmitryuv/atext-changeset [JavaScript] - A library for building collaborative rich-text editors using operational transformation. It's based on easysync spec from the Etherpad-Lite project
* https://github.com/goodow/realtime-store [Java] - Google Docs–style collaboration via the use of operational transforms. Documents are made of 4 types of collaborative elements: String, Lists, Maps and Custom objects. A Goodow Realtime Store collaborative document can have as many of these collaborative elements as they need
* https://github.com/Operational-Transformation/ot.js [JavaScript] - Operational Transformation Implementation (for text)
* https://github.com/automerge/automerge [JavaScript] - Automerge is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications in JavaScript
* https://github.com/automerge/trellis [JavaScript] - Trellis is a Trello clone built as an Electron desktop application. We built Trellis to demo MPL, a distributed persistence library that allows developers to build collaborative applications that are realtime, offline, and network partition tolerant. Uses [automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) library
* https://github.com/Webstrates/Webstrates [JavaScript] - With Webstrates, webpages become collaboratively editable in real-time. Changes to the Document Object Model (DOM) of a page persist and are synchronised to all connected clients of the same page using Operational Transformation through ShareDB.
* https://github.com/Webstrates/Codestrates [JavaSctipt] - Codestrates is a literate computing approach to developing interactive software inspired by interactive notebooks such as Jupyter notebook. However, in Codestrates, real-time collaboration is built in, it is possible to create stand-alone applications with persistent state, and to reprogram the functionality of the environment it self.
